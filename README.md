## About Me

🚀 I'm a software engineer with a keen interest in solving real-world problems through technology. My journey in the world of programming began when I first tinkered with BASIC on my school's ancient computer. Since then, I've come a long way, delving into various programming languages and technologies, constantly expanding my skillset.
